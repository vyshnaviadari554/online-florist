After developing a traditional retail flower business, in 2022 the owner decided to try something new by expanding into online sales with innovative business models and a more efficient way of selling flowers. The website was born with its motto of "Fresh, Fast and Fair".<br>
➤ We are proud to support our local communities as well as national not-for-profit and sports agencies, including Hockey Sports India, Ice Skating India and Basketball Children's Foundation.</p>

            <p>This flower shop website is highly recommended in India! I like that it comes with a food packet of flowers which has some instructions/details on how to extend the freshness of the flowers,
Which is a great help for people like me who know very little in gardening. </p>
